Eggs hatch into Dragon Yolk. They then develop further into Baby Dragons. Baby dragons develop into adolescents which are not to be trusted, they lean into their adult forms. The adult dragon is a mystery to all.

Sexuality in dragons:
Eggs have no sex organs. Dragon Yolks have no sex organs. Dragon Babys have no sex organs. Adolescents begin to develop sexual organs (this is why more dangerous). Adults have sexual organs.
